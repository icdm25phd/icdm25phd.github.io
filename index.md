The IEEE Big Data 2025 Ph.D. Forum provides an exceptional opportunity for doctoral students to present their ongoing research and dissertation plans in the field of big data analytics and related technologies. This forum aims to create a supportive environment where students at various stages of their Ph.D. journey can share their ideas, methodologies, and preliminary findings with experts in the field. Participants will benefit from constructive feedback from experienced researchers, engage in thought-provoking discussions with their peers, and potentially discover avenues for future collaboration within the big data community.

The forum is open exclusively to currently enrolled Ph.D. Students. Submissions encompass a wide spectrum of topics within big data research, reflecting the broad scope of the IEEE BigData 2025 Conference. This includes topics such as big data science and foundations, infrastructure, management, search and mining, learning and analytics, data ecosystems, foundation models, and applications across various domains like science, engineering, medicine, finance, business, and more. 

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings. Top submissions will be chosen for oral presentations during the Forum, while other accepted works will be showcased in interactive poster sessions.

Please note that in-person attendance is required for all participants in the Ph.D. Forum; remote participation is not available for this event.

## Application Material

### Papers

Submitted papers should not exceed 2 pages for the main content, with an optional third page reserved exclusively for references. All submissions must adhere to the official IEEE Conference Proceedings template in a two-column format, accessible via [IEEE Templates](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). Your submission should not be anonymized and should include a complete list of all authors and their affiliations, with the Ph.D. student as the primary author. Submissions should present preliminary findings in big data research that align with the broad spectrum of topics covered by the IEEE Big Data 2025 Conference.
    
Each Ph.D. student is limited to a single submission to this Ph.D. Forum. Once a paper is submitted, no alterations to the author list will be permitted after the submission is due, so please ensure all contributors are properly credited before submission. We are specifically seeking works-in-progress that demonstrate innovative approaches or novel insights in the field of big data. Submissions that do not meet these criteria or fall outside the realm of big data research may not be considered for the forum. We strongly encourage all applicants to carefully review these guidelines to ensure their submissions meet our requirements.
    

### CV
        
Please include a CV limited to 1 page. List your background, research publications, and other experiences (education, employment, open-source projects, etc.). The list of publications must include venue, year, and author list.
    

### Personal Statement

Please submit a 1-page personal statement. This document should outline your current research direction and potential thesis topics, summarize your academic achievements (such as publications, internships, and teaching experience), and explain what specific advice, insights, or ideas you hope to gain from the Ph.D. Forum. This personal statement helps us understand your research journey and allows us to tailor the forum experience to best support your growth as a doctoral student in the field of big data.  

#### Submissions must be in a single PDF file.
